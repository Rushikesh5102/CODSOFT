                <h3>Project 1 - Monitoring the Parameters of Induction Motors Using IoT</h3>
                <p>In this project, I designed and implemented an Internet of Things (IoT) system for real-time monitoring of key parameters in an Induction Motor. The goal was to enhance operational efficiency and prevent potential issues through continuous monitoring.</p>
                    <p>The IoT system utilized sensors to collect data on various parameters such as temperature, voltage, current, and rotational speed of the induction motor. These sensors were strategically placed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the motor's operating conditions.</p>
                        <p>The collected data was transmitted wirelessly to a central hub, where it was processed and analyzed in real-time. A user-friendly dashboard was developed to visualize the motor's performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor its health and identify any anomalies promptly.</p>
                            <p>This project not only showcased my skills in IoT and sensor integration but also emphasized the importance of proactive maintenance in industrial settings. By implementing this monitoring solution, we aimed to reduce downtime, enhance reliability, and optimize the overall performance of the Induction Motor.</p>

                <h3>Project 2 - Security Alarm System</h3>
                <p>The Security Alarm System is a robust and reliable solution designed to safeguard homes or premises against unauthorized access. This project involves the integration of various sensors, such as door/window magnetic contacts, motion detectors, and glass break sensors, to detect and respond to potential security breaches.</p>
                    <p>Upon detection of suspicious activity, the system triggers a loud alarm to deter intruders and immediately notifies the designated authorities or homeowners. The system is also equipped with features like remote arming/disarming via a mobile app, providing users with convenient control over their security.</p>
                        <p>By leveraging cutting-edge sensor technology and seamless connectivity, this Security Alarm System aims to provide peace of mind and enhance the overall safety of the protected area.</p>
